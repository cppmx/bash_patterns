# bash_patterns
It is a collection of small scripts in Bash to draw patterns in the terminal. I have started this project for fun and also to practice some basic programming skills in Bash.

# Usage
Clone the project with:
`clone https://github.com/cppmx/bash_patterns.git`

Enter into the bash_patterns directory and type:
`bash main.sh`

You can also change the permissions of the main script with the command:
`chmod +x main.sh`

Have fun!
